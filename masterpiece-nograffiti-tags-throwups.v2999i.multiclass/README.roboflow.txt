The dataset includes 2079 images.
Graffiti are annotated in Multi-Class Classification format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 400x400 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 4.25 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
